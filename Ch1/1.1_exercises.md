**∗1.** Analyze the logical forms of the following statements:

- **(a)** We’ll have either a reading assignment or homework problems, but we
won’t have both homework problems and a test.

    Let

    $R=$ We have a reading assignment

    $H=$ We have homework problems

    $T=$ We have a test

    Then (a) is

    $R \lor H \land \neg (H \land T)$

- **(b)** You won’t go skiing, or you will and there won’t be any snow.

    Let

    $W=$ You will go skiing

    $S=$ There will be snow

    Then (b) is

    $\neg W \lor (W \land \neg S)$

- **(c)** $\sqrt{7} \nleq 2$

    Breaking down the statement into its parts, we have

    $\neg(\sqrt{7}<2) \qquad \neg(\sqrt{7}=2)$

    Combining both, we have

    $\neg(\sqrt{7}<2) \land \neg(\sqrt{7}=2) \equiv\neg[(\sqrt{7}<2) \land (\sqrt{7}=2)]$

2. Analyze the logical forms of the following statements:
(a) Either John and Bill are both telling the truth, or neither of them is.
(b) I’ll have either fish or chicken, but I won’t have both fish and mashed
potatoes.
(c) 3 is a common divisor of 6, 9, and 15.
