**Example 1.1.2.** Analyze the logical forms of the following statements:
1. Either John went to the store, or we’re out of eggs.

    Let "John went to the store" be $P$ and "We're out of eggs" be $Q$, then the statement is $P\lor Q$

2. Joe is going to leave home and not come back.

    Let " Joe is going leaving home" be $P$ and "Joe is coming back" be $Q$, then the statement is $P\land \neg Q$

3. Either Bill is at work and Jane isn’t, or Jane is at work and Bill isn’t.

    Let $P=$ Bill is at work, $Q=$ Jane is at work, then

    $(P \land \neg Q )\lor () \neg P \land Q)$


**Example 1.1.3.** What English sentences are represented by the following
expressions?

1. $(\neg S \land L) \lor S$, where S stands for “John is stupid” and L stands for "John is lazy."
   
    Either John is not stupid and he's lazy, or John is stupid.

2. $\neg S \land (L \lor S)$, where S and L have the same meanings as before.

    John is not stupid, and either he's stupid or he's lazy.

3. $\neg(S \land L) \lor S$, with S and L still as before.

    Either John is not stupid nor lazy, or he is stupid.
