#### \*1. Consider the following theorem. (This theorem was proven in the introduction.) Theorem. Suppose $n$ is an integer larger than $1$ and $n$ is not prime. Then $2^n − 1$ is not prime.

- (a) Identify the hypotheses and conclusion of the theorem. Are the hypotheses true when $n = 6$? What does the theorem tell you in this instance? Is it right?

  Hypothesis: $n$ is larger than 1 and $n$ is not prime. $n \gt 1 \land \neg P(n)$

  Conclusion: $2^n-1$ is not prime.

  For $n=6$; the hypotheses are true and $2^6-1=63$, which is not prime, rendering the conclusion true.

- (b) What can you conclude from the theorem in the case $n = 15$? Check directly that this conclusion is correct.

  $2^{15}-1=32,767$, not prime, therefore, true

- (c) What can you conclude from the theorem in the case $n = 11$?

  $2^{11}-1=2,047$, not prime, therefore, true

#### 2. Consider the following theorem. (The theorem is correct, but we will not ask you to prove it here.)

**Theorem**. Suppose that $b^2 \gt 4ac$. Then the quadratic equation $ax^2 +
bx + c = 0$ has exactly two real solutions.

- (a) Identify the hypotheses and conclusion of the theorem.
- (b) To give an instance of the theorem, you must specify values for $a$, $b$, and $c$, but not $x$. Why?
- (c) What can you conclude from the theorem in the case $a = 2$, $b = −5$, $c = 3$? Check directly that this conclusion is correct.
- (d) What can you conclude from the theorem in the case $a = 2$, $b = 4$, $c = 3$?
