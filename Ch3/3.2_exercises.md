### \*1. This problem could be solved by using truth tables, but don't do it that way. Instead, use the methods for writing proofs discussed so far in this chapter. (See Example 3.2.4.)

- (a) Suppose $P \implies Q$ and $Q \implies R$ are both true. Prove that $P \implies R$ is true.

  | Givens         | Goal           |
  | :------------- | :------------- |
  | $P \implies Q$ | $P \implies R$ |
  | $Q \implies R$ |                |

  Since the goal is of the form $P\implies R$, we assume the antecedent and set the consequent as our new goal

  | Givens         | Goal |
  | :------------- | :--- |
  | $P \implies Q$ | $R$  |
  | $Q \implies R$ |      |
  | $P$            |      |

  The proof template looks as such:

  Suppose $P$<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Proof of R goes here.]<br>
  Therefore, $P\implies R$

  Since we now know $P$, by _modus ponens_ we can infer $Q$. We then add it to the list of givens

  | Givens         | Goal |
  | :------------- | :--- |
  | $P \implies Q$ | $R$  |
  | $Q \implies R$ |      |
  | $P$            |      |
  | $Q$            |      |

  Then, our proof template looks as below:

  Suppose $P$<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suppose Q<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Proof of R goes here.]<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, $P\implies Q$<br>
  Therefore, $P\implies R$

  Since we now know $Q$, by _modus ponens_ we can infer $R$. The proof is done.

  **Theorem.** _Suppose $P \implies Q$ and $Q \implies R$. Then $P \implies R$._

  _Proof._ Suppose $P \implies Q$, $Q \implies R$ and $P$. Since $P$ and $P \implies Q$, it follows that $Q$. Then, since $Q$ and $Q \implies R$, we can conclude that $R$. Therefore, $P \implies R$. $\square$

- (b) Suppose $\neg R \implies (P \implies \neg Q)$ is true. Prove that $P \implies (Q \implies R)$ is true.

  | Givens                                | Goal                        |
  | :------------------------------------ | :-------------------------- |
  | $\neg R \implies (P \implies \neg Q)$ | $P \implies (Q \implies R)$ |

  We can start by assuming that the goal antecedent is true. Then our givens are

  | Givens                                | Goal           |
  | :------------------------------------ | :------------- |
  | $\neg R \implies (P \implies \neg Q)$ | $Q \implies R$ |
  | $P$                                   |                |

  And our proof template has the form:

  Suppose $P$<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Proof of $Q\implies R$ goes here.]<br>
  Therefore, $P \implies (Q \implies R)$

  Iterating on the same strategy once more, as the new goal is another conditional

  | Givens                                | Goal |
  | :------------------------------------ | :--- |
  | $\neg R \implies (P \implies \neg Q)$ | $R$  |
  | $P$                                   |      |
  | $Q$                                   |      |

  Template:

  Suppose $P$<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suppose $Q$<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Proof of $R$ goes here.]<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, $Q \implies R$<br>
  Therefore, $P \implies (Q \implies R)$

  Since we now know $P \implies Q$ is true, then $P \implies \neg Q$ is false. Thus, since $\neg R \implies (P \implies \neg Q)$ is true, by _modus tollens_ we can conclude that $\neg R$ must also be false. Therefore, $R$ is true.

  **Theorem.** _Suppose $\neg R \implies (P \implies \neg Q)$ is true. Prove that $P \implies (Q \implies R)$ is true._

  _Proof._ Suppose $P$, $Q$ and $\neg R \implies (P \implies \neg Q)$. Since $P$ and $Q$, $P \implies Q$ is true, which means $P \implies \neg Q$ is false. By _modus tollens_ we can conclude that $\neg R$ must also be false, which in turn means $R$ is true. Since $P$, $Q$ and $R$ are true, $P \implies (Q \implies R)$ is true. Therefore, if $\neg R \implies (P \implies \neg Q)$, then $P \implies (Q \implies R)$. $\square$

### 2. This problem could be solved by using truth tables, but don't do it that way. Instead, use the methods for writing proofs discussed so far in this chapter. (See Example 3.2.4.)

- (a) Suppose $P \implies Q$ and $R \implies \neg Q$ are both true. Prove that $P \implies \neg R$ is true.

  | Givens              | Goal                |
  | :------------------ | :------------------ |
  | $P \implies Q$      | $P \implies \neg R$ |
  | $R \implies \neg Q$ |                     |

  Suppose $P$, then

  | Givens              | Goal     |
  | :------------------ | :------- |
  | $P \implies Q$      | $\neg R$ |
  | $R \implies \neg Q$ |          |
  | $P$                 |          |

  Since $P$ and $P \implies Q$, by _modus ponens_ we can conclude that $Q$ is true. Then, since we know $Q$ and $R \implies \neg Q$, we can conclude (by _modus tollens_) that $R$ is false, thus, $\neg R$ is true.

  **Theorem.** _Suppose $P \implies Q$ and $R \implies \neg Q$ are both true. Prove that $P \implies \neg R$ is true._

  _Proof._ Suppose $P$, since $P$ and $P \implies Q$, we can infer $Q$, then, since $Q$ and $R \implies \neg Q$, we can conclude $R$ is false, thus $\neg R$ is true. Therefore, if $P \implies Q$ and $R \implies \neg Q$, then $P \implies \neg R$. $\square$

* (b) Suppose that $P$ is true. Prove that $Q \implies \neg (Q \implies \neg P)$ is true.

  Rewriting $\neg (Q \implies \neg P)$, we have

  $\neg (\neg Q \lor \neg P) \equiv Q \land P$

  Then

  | Givens | Goal                   |
  | :----- | :--------------------- |
  | $P$    | $Q \implies Q \land P$ |

  Suppose $Q$, then

  | Givens | Goal        |
  | :----- | :---------- |
  | $P$    | $Q \land P$ |
  | $Q$    |             |

  **Theorem.** _Suppose that $P$ is true. Prove that $Q \implies \neg (Q \implies \neg P)$ is true._

  _Proof._ Suppose $Q$. By rewriting $Q \implies \neg (Q \implies \neg P)$ as it's equivalent $Q \implies Q \land P$, given $Q$ and $P$, we can conclude that, if $P$, then $Q \implies \neg (Q \implies \neg P)$. $\square$

### 3. Suppose $A \subseteq C$, and $B$ and $C$ are disjoint. Prove that if $x \in A$ then $x \notin B$.

$B$ and $C$ being disjoint means that $B \cap C=\varnothing$. This also means that $B \setminus C=B$. Then we have

| Givens                 | Goal                          |
| :--------------------- | :---------------------------- |
| $A \subseteq C$        | $x \in A \implies x \notin B$ |
| $B \cap C=\varnothing$ |                               |

Assume $x \in A$, then

| Givens                 | Goal         |
| :--------------------- | :----------- |
| $A \subseteq C$        | $x \notin B$ |
| $B \cap C=\varnothing$ |              |
| $x \in A$              |              |

Since $x \in A$ and $A \subseteq C$, it follows that $x \in C$. Now, since $B \cap C=\varnothing$, it follows that $x \notin B$. Therefore, if $x \in A$, then $x \notin B$

### 4. Suppose that $A \setminus B$ is disjoint from $C$ and $x \in A$. Prove that if $x \in C$ then $x \in B$.

| Givens                             | Goal                      |
| :--------------------------------- | :------------------------ |
| $A \setminus B \cap C=\varnothing$ | $x\in C \implies x \in B$ |
| $x \in A$                          |                           |

Assume $x \in C$, then

| Givens                              | Goal      |
| :---------------------------------- | :-------- |
| $(A \setminus B)\cap C=\varnothing$ | $x \in B$ |
| $x \in A$                           |           |
| $x \in C$                           |           |

Suppose $x \in C$, since $(A \setminus B) \cap C=\varnothing$, it follows that $x \notin A\setminus B$. Then, $x \notin A\setminus B\equiv \neg(x \in A \land x \notin B)\equiv x\notin A \lor x \in B$. Since $x \in A$, it follows that $x \in B$. Therefore, if $x\in A$, then $x \in B$.

### 5. Use the method of proof by contradiction to prove the theorem in Example 3.2.1.

**Theorem.** Suppose $A \cap C \subseteq B$ and $a \in C$. Then $a\notin A \setminus B$.

By contradiction. Assume $a \in A \setminus B \equiv (a \in A \land a \notin B)$. Since $a \in C$, then $a \in A \cap C \subseteq B$, thus it follows that $a \in B$. This contradicts the fact that $a \notin B$, therefore, $a \notin A \setminus B$.

### 6. Use the method of proof by contradiction to prove the theorem in Example 3.2.5.

**Theorem.** Suppose that $A \subseteq B$, $a \in A$, and $a \notin B \setminus C$. Then $a \in C$.

| Givens                   | Goal      |
| :----------------------- | :-------- |
| $A \subseteq B$          | $a \in C$ |
| $a \in A$                |           |
| $a \notin B \setminus C$ |           |

Suppose $a \notin C$. Given $x \in A$, and $A \subseteq B$, it follows that $a \in B$. Since $a \in B$, and $a \notin C$, it follows that $a \in B \setminus C$, but this contradicts the fact that $a \notin B \setminus C$. Therefore, $a \in C$.

#### 7. Suppose that $y + x = 2y âˆ’ x$, and $x$ and $y$ are not both zero. Prove that $ \neq 0$.

_Proof._ By contradiction. Assume $y = 0$, then, it follows from $(0) + x = 2(0) - x$ that $x = 0$. Since $y = 0$, and $x = 0$, this contradicts the fact that $x$ and $y$ are not both $0$. Therefore, $y = 0$.

### \*8. Suppose that $a$ and $b$ are nonzero real numbers. Prove that if $a \lt \frac{1}{a} \lt b \lt \frac{1}{b}$ then $a \lt -1$.

Since $a$ and $b$ could be positive or negative, we cannot multiply any of the inequations by either of them.

| :------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------- |
| $a \in \R, a \neq 0$ | $a \lt \frac{1}{a} \lt b \lt \frac{1}{b} \implies a \lt -1$ |
| $b \in \R, b \neq 0$ |                                                             |

Suppose $a \lt \frac{1}{a} \lt b \lt \frac{1}{b}$, then

| Givens                                    | Goal       |
| :---------------------------------------- | :--------- |
| $a \in \R, a \neq 0$                      | $a \lt -1$ |
| $b \in \R, b \neq 0$                      |            |
| $a \lt \frac{1}{a} \lt b \lt \frac{1}{b}$ |            |
